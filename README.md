# Welcome to my coding den!

I am a law graduate who decided to change careers and I am trying to better and polish my coding skills. Recently graduated from a Full-stack course, currently working on my front-end skills.

There are a few repos that were just test or assignments, I am still cleaning up my github and messing around with projects.
I am a bit of a gaming and language nerd. Way too much into astrology and random topics.

Artist on free time.

You can reach out to me in:

Português | English | Español | 日本語 |

Studying: Finnish, Chinese, German and Romanian
